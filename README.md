# Broken-Calculator
  
A calculator that is *so done with life* it refuses to calculate.

This is a fun, aesthetic, responsive calculator built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed to look cool, act dramatic, and give up on you every time you press `=`.

> **"idk bro just leave me alone 😭"**  
– the calculator, every single time
